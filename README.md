# JSF_Auth

## This projects deals with very basics of JSF.

* In this project, the application won't let you go inside the other URLs (/forum.xhtml). And once you login into the system, it then let you go to the forum page where you can add record, edit and delete them as well. All the records will be stored in database. 

* No connection pools have been used here, and also the database is connected using basic JDBC resources.
